Deathstar

> Deathstar visualizes deaths in Ghent.

I created Deathstar as part of my final school assignement in year 1.
Unfortunately it was turned down. What's posted here is the full project.

The project is written in the [Processing](http://processing.org) language, which is based on Java.

Using the `sphere` function baked into processing data from a JSON file is passed through.
The sphere shapeshifts according to the relative deaths in a certain area.

The JSON file used is a file from OpenData Ghent which contains deaths between 1999 and 2009 (not so up to date Ghent…)

Todo's
======
* As for the current state of the project it's just a sphere rotating over certain axis'.
* For test purposes the shapeshifting of the sphere has been mapped to the arrow keys.
* JSON passing-trough is yet to be implemented
